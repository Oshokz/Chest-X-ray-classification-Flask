This projectinvolves the development of a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras, designed to analyze chest X-ray images. The model is trained to classify images into four categories: Covid-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia and Tuberculosis. The model achieves 97% accuracy in distinguishing between the four chest conditions.
